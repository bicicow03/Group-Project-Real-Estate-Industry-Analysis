    "The rental dataset reflects only observed/scraped listings and may not necessarily be representative of all rental properties available within Victoria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, using several external datasets (resulting in 57 total features) may introduce potential multicollinearity between features (e.g. number of schools vs suburb population). Thus, the model may capture correlations rather than causal effects. However, we aim to address this through feature selection and feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the external datasets span different time periodsâ€”some are current (e.g., crime and transport data), while others, such as the ABS Census (last updated in 2021), are less recent. This temporal mismatch may introduce inconsistencies, as demographic or social trends could have shifted in the intervening years. Thus, we assume that the characteristics captured in older datasets remain reasonably stable over time, and any changes since collection are gradual enough not to invalidate their use in modelling current rental prices."

=======
    "The model we incorporated for rent forecasting was a time series model using Auto ARIMA, designed to capture seasonal trends in quarterly rental data from 2000 to 2024. Each suburb and property type was modeled separately to account for local variations in rental dynamics. The model produced five-year forecasts (2025â€“2029), allowing us to estimate future rent trajectories across different property categories. The results highlight that 2-bedroom houses and flats were the most predictable, while larger properties such as 3- and 4-bedroom dwellings showed greater volatility, likely reflecting lower transaction volumes and higher sensitivity to economic fluctuations. The suburb with the largest increase in predicted growth is Mildura while the lowest is Clayton\n",
